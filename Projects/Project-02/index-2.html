	<div class="content1">We are like kaleidoscopes: we are all made up of the same molecules in ourselves, but through different choices and actions, we become so different.</div>
	<div class="content">For designers and artists, we often need a lot of inspiration for our own output, and these sources of inspiration come from the artwork of others. So how do we, as designers, define originality? In my opinion the line between originality and copying can be explained by genetics.

	You have a bunch of genes from each of your parents, so are you unique? Why is it? You can find a lot of similarities to your parents in all of you. But you are indeed unique because no one else is like you.

	Nowadays, many designers and artists get hung up on the originality of ideas and works. But I think if you get too hung up on originality, it's like I said: are you original yourself?

	So I think the difference between originality and copying is the degree of similarity between the two.
