			We do not know who invented the concept of glass windows from offices out to hallways. But these inner
windows are a beautifully simple design that enhances peripheral reach and locatedness.
The hallway window extends our periphery by creating a two-way channel for clues about the environment.
Whether it is motion of other people down the hall (its time for a lunch; the big meeting is starting), or noticing
the same person peeking in for the third time while you are on the phone (they really want to see me; I forgot an
appointment), the window connects the person inside to the nearby world.
Inner windows also connect with those who are outside the office. A light shining out into the hall means
someone is working late; someone picking up their office means this might be a good time for a casual chat.
These small clues become part of the periphery of a calm and comfortable workplace.
Office windows illustrate a fundamental property of motion between center and periphery. Contrast them with an
open office plan in which desks are separated only by low or no partitions. Open offices force too much to the
center. For example, a person hanging out near an open cubicle demands attention by social conventions of
privacy and politeness.
There is less opportunity for the subtle clue of peeking through a window without eavesdropping on a
conversation. The individual, not the environment, must be in charge of moving things from center to periphery
and back.
The inner office window is a metaphor for what is most exciting about the Internet, namely the ability to locate
and be located by people passing by on the information highway, while retaining partial control of the context,
timing, and use of the information thereby obtained.
